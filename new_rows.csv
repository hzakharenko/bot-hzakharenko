https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::sex-offender-registry-1,Sex Offender Registry,"In 2000, the District of Columbia City Council passed the Sex Offender Registration law. This law requires a person convicted, or found not guilty by reason of insanity, of a registration-required offense to register with the District of Columbia, provided the individual lives, works, or attends school here. Generally speaking, an offense requiring registration is a felony sexual assault (regardless of the age of the victim); an offense involving sexual abuse or exploitation of minors; or sexual abuse of wards, patients, or clients. The Court Services and Offender Supervisory Agency (CSOSA) will complete the initial registration. Other District agencies also have the responsibility to notify either CSOSA or MPD about sex offenders. These agencies include the Department of Corrections, Forensic and Mental Health Unit of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and the District of Columbia Superior Court.",2014-02-06 20:58:48+00:00,"April 7, 2023",2023-04-07
