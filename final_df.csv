Here’s the explanation from OP regarding how they came to create their list:“To determine the number of grocery stores in the District, we analyzed existing business licenses in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (2018) Business License Verification system (located at https://eservices.dcra.dc.gov/BBLV/Default.aspx). To distinguish grocery stores from convenience stores, we applied the Alcohol and Beverage Regulation Administration’s (ABRA) definition of a fullservice grocery store. This definition requires a store to be licensed as a grocery store, sell at least six different food categories, dedicate either 50% of the store’s total square feet or 6,000 square feet to selling food, and dedicate at least 5% of the selling area to each food category. This definition can be found at https://abra.dc.gov/page/full-service-grocery-stores. To distinguish small grocery stores from large grocery stores, we categorized large grocery stores as those 10,000 square feet or more. This analysis was conducted using data from the WDCEP’s Retail and Restaurants webpage (located at https://wdcep.com/dc-industries/retail/) and using ARCGIS Spatial Analysis tools when existing data was not available. Our final numbers differ slightly from existing reports like the DC Hunger Solutions’ Closing the Grocery Store Gap and WDCEP’s Grocery Store Opportunities Map; this difference likely comes from differences in our methodology and our exclusion of stores that have closed.”We also conducted a visual analysis of locations and relied on personal experience of visits to locations to determine whether they should be included in the list.",2015-02-27 20:36:08+00:00,

Generally, census blocks are small in area (e.g., a block in a city). Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of features (e.g., roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way). In remote areas, census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data.Census Block Numbers—Census blocks are numbered uniquely within the boundaries of each state, county, census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first character of the tabulation block number identifies the block group. A block number can only be unique by using the decennial census state (STATEFP&lt;YR&gt;), county (COUNTYFP&lt;YR&gt;), census tract (TRACTCE&lt;YR&gt;), and block (BLOCKCE&lt;YR&gt;)+.

Current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block group relationships due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the decade. For example, block 3001 might move due to a change in the census tract boundary. Even if the block is no longer in block group 3, the block number (3001) will not change. However, the GEOID for that block, identifying block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles because block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes.Block groups delineated for the 2020 Census generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. Local participants delineated most block groups as part of the Census Bureau's PSAP. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains one or more block groups and block groups have unique numbers within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and AIANNH areas.Block groups have a valid range of zero (0) through nine (9). Block groups beginning with a zero generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::wetland-types,Wetland Types,"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands_Project_Metadata layer, which contains project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.",2015-02-27 20:55:49+00:00,

Typically, these lots are numbered 1 through 799 with no number being used more than once in a Square.  Exceptions to this rule:When the 1-799 range has been exhausted within a square, the Surveyor’s Office assigns numbers from 1200 or may even use 8000 and aboveFor reasons unknown, 42 Squares have record lot numbers greater than 799 but less than 1200Additionally, in most case scenario’s, a piece of property must be a Record Lot before a building permit will be issued for that site in the District of Columbia, and all proposed Record Lots are carefully reviewed by Zoning Administration officials for compliance with the city’s Zoning Ordinances.  Other agencies that review new record lots besides OS are Office of Zoning, Office of Planning, the Dept. of Public Works, Historic Preservation and DDOT.Record lots are defined only when requested by property owners, normally when they are seeking a building permit.  Record lots are recorded in Plat Books and Subdivision Books in the Office of the Surveyor. These documents are bound volumes of historical representations of the locations of property lines, and they include record dimensions, though typically no bearings of lines.  These lots are located within squares, which usually correspond to one or two city blocks. Certain record lots can also be classified as “of-lots”.  An ""Of-Lot"" is the D.C. Surveyor’s Office term for describing “Remaining/Part of Original Lot X”In the record lot feature class, if a domain value of 1 resides in the “OF_LOT” field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified.

Their boundaries were also depicted (in many cases approximated), in large books in DCRA's Office of the Surveyor. Until the late 1960s, building permits were routinely issued by the city for new construction on Parcels, but today all Parcels, like Tax Lots, must be converted into subdivision Lots of Record before permits will be issued for exterior work. Parcels are only found in the old “County of Washington,” north of Florida Ave and east of the Anacostia River. There are no Parcels found within the original city limits or Georgetown.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::square-points,Square Points,"Squares are calculated by the outer extents of the record or tax lots within a defined area (typically a city block).  There are roughly 4896 active squares.  A Square is similar to a city block. Squares were numbered starting at 1 and are currently in the 6000 series. Not all squares are active. A common cause of squares becoming inactive has been through street closing and combining squares. When the squares are combined usually the lower square number is killed and the higher square number is used for the combined square.  For example if squares 1 and 2 are combined, square 1 is killed and the combination becomes square 2.Spatial locations:Each Square is an Island, alone unto itself.  There is not now, and has never been, any citywide Survey Coordinate System in D.C.  Most squares are unrelated to other Squares by “Measured.” They are related by Record.  Street width is approximate. You cannot rely on the published official street widths to set up property lines or determine right-of-way. There is digital scan information available from DDOT regarding Right-of-Way.  Some Squares are divided by streets. That is, the same Square continues on the other side of the street.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::tax-lot-points,Tax Lot Points,"Tax Lot points. DC's Real Property Tax Administration defines assessment and taxation lots, often referred to as A&amp;T lots or simply tax lots. These lots are strictly for real estate taxation purposes and normally defined under two circumstances: When property owners ask for their real property tax bills to be consolidated, after they have bought several contiguous record lots; this is called a combine;When part of a record lot is sold, but no new record lot is yet defined; this is called a split request. Tax lots are not determined by survey, and are therefore not official lots in the same way record lots are. These lots are normally numbered between 800 and 1999within a square to differentiate them from record lots on the property tax maps. When a tax lot is established by RPTA, an A&amp;T Plat is generated by RPTA and forwarded to the surveyor’s office. These A&amp;T Plats are not reviewed but simply filed by the Surveyor; they do not comply with the standards required of subdivision plats, and are not recorded. Tax Lots are not normally acceptable when applying for building permits and must be converted to Record Lots through the normal subdivision process involving the D.C. Surveyor’s Office before permits will be issued. The only exception is if the lot does not face a public street. Furthermore, at the time of their creation and platting, there is no review made of tax lots for compliance with D.C. Zoning, Subdivisions or any other ordinances. These lots are simply pieces of property, owned by somebody, described in deeds, for which tax bills are sent and real estate taxes are collected by the city. Some Record Lots also function in this capacity. Geographically, tax lots typically overlay layers such as record lots or sometimes reservations. There are known instances where tax lots do not overlay these types of layers. Up until approximately 1972, A&amp;T lots were only created by the Tax Assessor out of lands that had been previously Record Lots at some point in their history. For a short period of time in the early to mid 1970’s, a decision was made to start eliminating fractional parcels (see definition below) and make them all into A&amp;T lots. The intent was to do away with Parcels altogether and have all properties in the city be either tax lots or record lots. By doing this, they converted unsubdivided parcels into A&amp;T lots where no underlying record lot exists. There is often little or no historical source information about these types of transactions therefore vectorizing them often required vast amounts of research.",2015-02-27 21:09:57+00:00,

Please refer to the common ownership lots layer in https://opendata.dc.gov for the most current data on ownership. Property Owner Points. This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the square field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file. Attribute features with square, suffix, and lot numbers (SSLs) were included as an AutoCAD block.",2015-02-27 21:10:00+00:00,

DC's Real Property Tax Administration defines assessment and taxation lots, often referred to as A&amp;T lots or simply tax lots. These lots are strictly for real estate taxation purposes and normally defined under two circumstances: When property owners ask for their real property tax bills to be consolidated, after they have bought several contiguous record lots; this is called a combine;When part of a record lot is sold, but no new record lot is yet defined; this is called a split request. Tax lots are not determined by survey, and are therefore not official lots in the same way record lots are. These lots are normally numbered between 800 and 1999within a square to differentiate them from record lots on the property tax maps. When a tax lot is established by RPTA, an A&amp;T Plat is generated by RPTA and forwarded to the surveyor’s office. These A&amp;T Plats are not reviewed but simply filed by the Surveyor; they do not comply with the standards required of subdivision plats, and are not recorded. Tax Lots are not normally acceptable when applying for building permits and must be converted to Record Lots through the normal subdivision process involving the D.C. Surveyor’s Office before permits will be issued. The only exception is if the lot does not face a public street. Furthermore, at the time of their creation and platting, there is no review made of tax lots for compliance with D.C. Zoning, Subdivisions or any other ordinances. These lots are simply pieces of property, owned by somebody, described in deeds, for which tax bills are sent and real estate taxes are collected by the city. Some Record Lots also function in this capacity. Geographically, tax lots typically overlay layers such as record lots or sometimes reservations. There are known instances where tax lots do not overlay these types of layers. Up until approximately 1972, A&amp;T lots were only created by the Tax Assessor out of lands that had been previously Record Lots at some point in their history. For a short period of time in the early to mid 1970’s, a decision was made to start eliminating fractional parcels (see definition below) and make them all into A&amp;T lots. The intent was to do away with Parcels altogether and have all properties in the city be either tax lots or record lots. By doing this, they converted unsubdivided parcels into A&amp;T lots where no underlying record lot exists. There is often little or no historical source information about these types of transactions therefore vectorizing them often required vast amounts of research.",2015-02-27 21:10:06+00:00,

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::square-boundaries,Square Boundaries,"Squares are calculated by the outer extents of the record or tax lots within a defined area (typically a city block).  There are roughly 4896 active squares.  A Square is similar to a city block. Squares were numbered starting at 1 and are currently in the 6000 series. Not all squares are active. A common cause of squares becoming inactive has been through street closing and combining squares. When the squares are combined usually the lower square number is killed and the higher square number is used for the combined square.  For example if squares 1 and 2 are combined, square 1 is killed and the combination becomes square 2.Spatial locations:Each Square is an Island, alone unto itself.  There is not now, and has never been, any citywide Survey Coordinate System in D.C.  Most squares are unrelated to other Squares by “Measured.” They are related by Record.  Street width is approximate. You cannot rely on the published official street widths to set up property lines or determine right-of-way. There is digital scan information available from DDOT regarding Right-of-Way.  Some Squares are divided by streets. That is, the same Square continues on the other side of the street.  Since there is no citywide Survey Coordinate System, squares were placed in their approximate location.  This process is known as “best fit”.",2015-02-27 21:10:08+00:00,

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::condo-approval-lots,Condo Approval Lots,"Condo lots are individual lots for each condominium. The lot numbers normally range from 2000-6999. These condo lots are not geographically defined other than being within a air rights, record, tax or a combination of lots that has one or more condo buildings within it. A condo regime number is assigned to each residential Condo application or Article of Confederation regardless of how many buildings there are at any one site. The Regime number starts with a 1, 2, or 3 depending upon where the condo is located and where they fall in the tri-annual assessment process of RPTA. All numbers after the first are consecutive. RPTA maintains the master list of Regime numbers for residential properties. Commercial condos are not associated with a Regime number and in order to properly track all condos, a unique Regime number was created. RPTA then establishes individual accounts for each condominium unit and assigns a condo lot number to that account. RPTA maintains the master list of Regime numbers and their relationship to approved condos. There are roughly 66571 condo lots and there associations are as follows: 49486 condos were approved for record lots, 16867 were approved for tax lots, 2817 were approved for air rights lots, and 2600 were approved for both air rights and tax lots. The CondoPly layer was created to assist users in visualizing the relationship between ground surface lots (Record Lots), overlay lots (Air Rights &amp; Tax Lots), and the associated Condos. When Condos are approved for ground lots, those lots remain in the production (active) layer and attributes updated to reflect the new condos. When Condos are approved for overlay lots, those lots are killed (dead lots) and archived to their respective history layer. Condo dwellings can also be queried city-wide via the individual VPM layers (active Record lots, dead Air Rights &amp; Tax lots) where the value in the “UNDERLIES_CONDO” field is equal to 1.",2015-02-27 21:10:09+00:00,

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::buildings-3d-detailed-roof,Buildings 3D - Detailed Roof,"This dataset contains
		3D rooftops for the District of Columbia in ESRI multipatch format. It includes
		structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates
		based on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of
		Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction
		process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures
		from them to form roof polygons.Attributes containing roof height, slope and
		orientation are included. This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset
		produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to
		building rooftops identified in the course of the District of Columbia’s
		separate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were
		added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was
		intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were
		identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building
		rooftop changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not
		have been captured. 
		
		This dataset contains
		rooftops, including protrusions such as gabled windows, chimneys, elevator
		utility rooms, etc.. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke
		out those roof elements into separate files, as well as deliveries which included
		complete 3D buildings with rooftops and facades. In many instances, row-houses
		and other contiguous building rooftops could not be broken apart using the
		process methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire
		blocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they
		can be distinguished easily. Additionally, the process captured small features,
		such as canopy umbrellas and other structures as building rooftops and these
		features may exist at various locations in the dataset.Many data gaps in the
		earlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery)
		are corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC’s available
		planimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are
		omitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of
		99% of the District’s buildings are reflected in this dataset.All DC GIS data
		is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.

These have been merged with Census poverty data to estimate how much of the population within these areas is food insecure (below 185% of the federal poverty line in addition to living in a low food access area).Office of Planning GIS followed several steps to create this layer, including: transit analysis, to eliminate areas of the District within a 10-minute walk of a grocery store; non-residential analysis, to eliminate areas of the District which do not contain residents and cannot classify as low food access areas (such as parks and the National Mall); and Census tract division, to estimate population and poverty rates within the newly created polygon boundaries.Fields contained in this layer include:Intermediary calculation fields for the aforementioned analysis, and:PartPop2: The total population estimated to live within the low food access area polygon (derived from Census tract population, assuming even distribution across the polygon after removing non-residential areas, followed by the removal of population living within a grocery store radius.)PrtOver185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income above 185% of the federal poverty line (the food secure population)PrtUnd185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income below 185% of the federal poverty line (the food insecure population)PercentUnd185: A calculated field showing PrtUnd185 as a percent of PartPop2. This is the percent of the population in the polygon which is food insecure (both living in a low food access area and below 185% of the federal poverty line).Note that the polygon representing Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling was removed from this analysis. While technically classifying as a low food access area based on the OP Grocery Stores layer (since the JBAB Commissary, which only serves military members, is not included in that layer), it is recognized that those who do live on the base have access to the commissary for grocery needs.Last updated November 2017.",2018-03-19 16:37:09+00:00,

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::stop-incidents-2010-2017,Stop Incidents 2010-2017,"Whenever a forcible stop or a frisk is conducted, MPD officers are required to submit an incident report which includes specific factors which supported the determination that reasonable suspicion was present to use the minimum amount of force necessary to stop or frisk a person. Although the primary purpose of the stop and frisk incident report is to collect information on forcible stops or frisks, officers frequently use this report to document non-forcible stops. Thus, the incident type “stop and frisk” may include non-forcible stops, forcible stops, and frisks. Each row of information in the attached dataset represents an individual associated with a stop and frisk incident. Not all individuals of an incident may have been stopped or frisked. For example, two individuals may have been associated with a stop or frisk incident but only one person may have been stopped. The other person may include a witness. Moreover, two individuals may have been stopped where only one person is frisked. A “stop” is a temporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest a person. A “frisk” is a limited protective search on a person to determine the presence of concealed weapons and/or dangerous instruments.https://mpdc.dc.gov/node/1310236",2018-04-05 16:01:35+00:00,

A field contact report is also used to record general contact with a citizen. This dataset only captures the field contact type where the officer has indicated it is a stop by classifying it as a “pedestrian stop”, “vehicle stop”, or “bicycle stop.”A “stop” is a temporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest a person. A “frisk” is a limited protective search on a person to determine the presence of concealed weapons and/or dangerous instruments.The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) upgraded its records management system in 2012 and 2015. During each implementation, data collection processes may have changed. For example:- The date field for field contact reports prior to January 2, 2012 was not migrated to the current record management system. As a result, tens of thousands of records carry a date of January 1, 2012. Therefore, MPD is unable to provide field contact data prior to January 2, 2012.- With the implementation of the most recent RMS in 2015, MPD began collecting race and ethnicity data according to the United States Census Bureau standards (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html). As a result, Hispanic, which was previously categorized under the Race field, is currently captured under Ethnicity. Race and ethnicity data are based on officer observation, which may or may not be accurate. Individuals are not required to provide their date of birth and/or age; therefore, there may be blank and/or unknown ages.https://mpdc.dc.gov/node/1310236",2018-04-05 16:05:53+00:00,

ShotSpotter has also enhanced their ability to distinguish gunshots from other impulse noises. For example, the number of impulse noises coded as gunshots during Independence Day celebrations have significantly decreased over the past four years.ShotSpotter does not provide coverage for the entire District of Columbia. Official coverage areas are designed by ShotSpotter in conjunction with MPD, to target high population density areas with frequent sounds of gunshots incidents. A ShotSpotter incident may involve one gunshot or multiple gunshots depending on the time elapsed between each shot. Each incident is given a serial number ID when it occurs.This data may include duplicate incidents or unverified shots that may have occurred outside of official coverage areas. Classifications are assigned by ShotSpotter and represent their assessment of what kind of impulse noise occurred. The Latitude and Longitude of the incidents are rounded to three decimal places due to privacy concerns. This roughly corresponds to a 100 meter resolution.",2018-05-21 14:45:35+00:00,

During the annual mosquito season in Washington DC, usually from April – October, DC Health deploys surveillance and mitigation methods to control the mosquito population in the District. DC Health (also known as the D.C. Department of Health or formerly DOH) has been trapping and testing mosquitoes for West Nile virus (WNV) for well over a decade. Starting in 2016, and in response to the Zika outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, DC Health substantially increased mosquito monitoring activities across the city. There were a total of 28 sites and 36 traps across the 8 wards. Data was submitted to the Centers for Disease Control MoquitoNet Portal.Note: the 2017 analysis does not include data for October. This is because October of 2017 would have skewed the results far too much based on a few variables that occurred. For example, the number of traps which had failed by the end of the season.Mosquito species in Washington, D.C.:Culex Pipiens, Salinarius and Culex Restuan: spread West Nile VirusAedes aegypti : according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), health experts have determined this species to be the most competent vector, capable of transmitting Zika to the human population. To date, none of the Aedes aegypti trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus.Aedes albopictus: capable of spreading Zika to people. However, health experts are still learning whether it is likely to do so as it appears at this time, it is not as competent a vector for transmitting Zika as is the Aedes aegypti. Just because a mosquito can carry the virus does not mean that it will cause disease. So far, none of the Aedes albopictus trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus.Aedes japonicus: normally found in South Florida, is present in D.C. in small numbers.

For a one-week permit, you do not need a doctor’s certification. The one-week permit is not renewable within a one-year period.Temporary PlacardsYou can get a temporary disability placard if you have a physical condition that substantially impairs your mobility that is expected to last no longer than 8 years. Your medical practitioner must certify the application and indicate the expected length of your disability. If you find you need your disabled privileges longer, you must submit a new application with a medical practitioner's certification.Long-Term PlacardsYou can get a long-term disability if you have a long-term disability. The list of qualifying disabilities is included on the application for the placard. You do not need a medical practitioner's certification if you have an obvious missing lower extremity or you use a motorized wheelchair.The long-term placard is valid up to 8 years to coincide with the expiration of your driver license or identification card. To renew it, you must submit a new application with a medical practitioner's certification.Temporary and long-term placards expire on the last day of the month and year indicated on the placard.Placards or permits should be hung from the rearview mirror while the vehicle is parked in a space authorized for the disabled and must be displayed and readable from the front windshield. They must be removed from the rearview mirror while the vehicle is in motion.",2019-10-16 14:02:07+00:00,

This is analogous to the removal of mass points for the same reason in a traditional photogrammetrically compiled DTM. This process was done in batch using proprietary software. The technicians then used proprietary software for the production of the lidar-derived hydro-flattened bare earth DEM surface in initial grid format at 1 m GSD. Water bodies (inland ponds and lakes), inland streams and rivers, and island holes were hydro-flattened within the DEM. Once the initial, hydro-flattened bare earth DEM was generated, the tiles were checked to ensure that the grid spacing met specifications.

The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see Accuracy of the Data).  The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables. For processing notes visit Esri Demographics team layers.",2020-01-07 15:30:45+00:00,

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::dc-health-planning-neighborhoods,DC Health Planning Neighborhoods,"This dataset contains polygons that represent the boundaries of statistical neighborhoods as defined by the DC Department of Health (DC Health). DC Health delineates statistical neighborhoods to facilitate small-area analyses and visualization of health, economic, social, and other indicators to display and uncover disparate outcomes among populations across the city. The neighborhoods are also used to determine eligibility for some health services programs and support research by various entities within and outside of government. DC Health Planning Neighborhood boundaries follow census tract 2010 lines defined by the US Census Bureau. Each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. This allows for easier comparison to Census data and calculation of rates per population (including estimates from the American Community Survey and Annual Population Estimates). These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries. Origin of boundaries: each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. They were originally determined in 2015 as part of an analytical research project with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to define small area estimates of life expectancy. Census tracts were grouped roughly following the Office of Planning Neighborhood Cluster boundaries, where possible, and were made just large enough to achieve standard errors of less than 2 for each neighborhood's calculation of life expectancy. The resulting neighborhoods were used in the DC Health Equity Report (2018) with updated names. HPNs were modified slightly in 2019, incorporating one census tract that was consistently suppressed due to low numbers into a neighboring HPN (Lincoln Park incorporated into Capitol Hill). Demographic information were analyzed to identify the bordering group with the most similarities to the single census tract. A second change split a neighborhood (GWU/National Mall) into two to facilitate separate analysis.",2020-05-11 14:55:39+00:00,

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::dc-health-planning-neighborhoods-to-census-tracts,DC Health Planning Neighborhoods to Census Tracts,"This dataset contains polygons that represent the boundaries of statistical neighborhoods as defined by the DC Department of Health (DC Health). DC Health delineates statistical neighborhoods to facilitate small-area analyses and visualization of health, economic, social, and other indicators to display and uncover disparate outcomes among populations across the city. The neighborhoods are also used to determine eligibility for some health services programs and support research by various entities within and outside of government. DC Health Planning Neighborhood boundaries follow census tract 2010 lines defined by the US Census Bureau. Each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. This allows for easier comparison to Census data and calculation of rates per population (including estimates from the American Community Survey and Annual Population Estimates). These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries. Origin of boundaries: each neighborhood is a group of between one and seven different, contiguous census tracts. They were originally determined in 2015 as part of an analytical research project with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to define small area estimates of life expectancy. Census tracts were grouped roughly following the Office of Planning Neighborhood Cluster boundaries, where possible, and were made just large enough to achieve standard errors of less than 2 for each neighborhood's calculation of life expectancy. The resulting neighborhoods were used in the DC Health Equity Report (2018) with updated names. HPNs were modified slightly in 2019, incorporating one census tract that was consistently suppressed due to low numbers into a neighboring HPN (Lincoln Park incorporated into Capitol Hill). Demographic information were analyzed to identify the bordering group with the most similarities to the single census tract. A second change split a neighborhood (GWU/National Mall) into two to facilitate separate analysis.",2020-05-21 15:19:43+00:00,

DDOT is preparing for this bright future: in addition to delivering complex projects like the beautiful new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, we have launched environmentally sustainable transportation options like the DC Streetcar, and we have transformed the DC Circulator into the best way to connect and access our diverse and beautiful neighborhoods. Our goal is to make transit more efficient with projects that create dedicated space for buses like our Car Free Lanes and the K Street Transitway, the first such project that will help buses move quicker through the downtown core. Along the way, with the help of federal and community stakeholders and partners, we have made Washington, DC into one of the nation’s most bicycle-friendly cities. But we are not done yet! Our Vision Zero initiative brings together engineering, education, and enforcement resources from across District government to create safe streets for everyone. moveDC is our long-range transportation plan, built on a framework of goals: safety, equity, mobility, project delivery, management and operations, sustainability, and enjoyable spaces. It reflects our commitment to not only provide excellent transportation facilities and services, but to deliver them in a manner that addresses structural injustices and inequities. moveDC’s goals, policies, and strategies put this commitment into practice by making equity an explicit component in the prioritization and delivery of both projects and services, just as equity is a critical framework of our transportation infrastructure. The moveDC planning process was inclusive, with participation from hundreds of residents and stakeholders from every ward of the District. Now, let’s moveDC together. Sincerely, Muriel Bowser, Mayor “moveDC reflects
		our commitment
		to not only
		provide excellent
		transportation
		facilities and
		services, but to
		deliver them

		that addresses
		structural injustices
		and inequities.” Mayor Muriel Bowser A Message From DDOT Director Everett Lott moveDC is our long-range transportation plan, built on a framework of goals: safety, equity, mobility, project delivery, management and operations, sustainability, and enjoyable spaces. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) updated our long-range plan during an unprecedented health emergency that created challenges to connecting with District residents. However, it also highlighted opportunities for DDOT to proactively improve how we move people and goods, and to support our community and businesses by rethinking the use of public space. The moveDC strategies reflect what we learned. moveDC will make traveling in the District safer, cleaner, faster, and easier. We will support multimodal solutions that provide options for traveling. Safety remains our highest priority, and we are committed to achieving our Vision Zero goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries by 2024. Equity will be considered in everything we do — moveDC will ensure that our investments in transportation benefit all residents, visitors, and commuters. Please join with me as we moveDC.Sincerely, Everett Lott, Director “Equity will be considered in everything we do — moveDC will ensure our investments in transportation benefit all residents, visitors, and commuters.” DDOT Director Everett Lott Contents Keep me updated Want to stay in the loop on moveDC?

Data include only community infections, not infections that happen in congregate settings. Congregate settings include jails, assisted living, and shelters. We restrict to community infections because infections that occur in congregate settings can be controlled through infection control efforts within the institution/facility. Users of the data should use the symptom onset date or estimated start of the infectious period (i.e., when a person can transmit the disease to another person), rather than the report date to give a better understanding of how the virus is spread across the District. June 22 was the calendar date where the policy effect took place. Data through June 22 are reported on June 24, and represent a symptom onset date of June 15. This data is used to calculate the Reopening DC metric with number of days where cases in the community by date of symptom onset (for symptomatic individuals) or estimated start of infectious period (for asymptomatic individuals) have decreased. A day of decrease is defined as a day where the number of new cases is less than 2 standard deviations of the 5 day rolling average from the previous low OR there has not been 3 days of consecutive increase. The count resets to the day with the closest most recent value when a peak is detected. The days in between are no longer counted.

If Rt is above 1, the number of daily new infections will grow at an exponential rate. If it is below 1, the number of daily new infections will decrease. If field {ABOVE1=1}, then the transmission rate for that day did not meet the Reopening DC metric. The effective reproduction number must remain below 1 for a consecutive 5 days in order to achieve Reopening DC. The reproduction number is calculated in retrospect - data reported today is used to calculate the Rt for 14 days ago. This allows time for reported cases on a day to be more complete (~75% of cases reported), and calculates Rt over a 7−day window. Rt is primarily affected by 1) under-reporting rate over time, 2) caseload by start of infectious period, and 3) the serial interval (average between the start of the infectious period in one individual, and the start of the infectious period in an individual they infect). Rt is estimated from cases by start of infectious period using the EpiEstim algorithm, and the day plotted is the midpoint of the 7 day window. Rt may not be a reliable indicator of transmission as cases decline, as it becomes more uncertain with less data, and can be heavily impacted by disease events in other states which are imported into DC. For this reason, Rt is not measured at geographies below the city level. This data is used to calculate the Reopening DC metric where the effective reproduction number must be below 1 for 5 days.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::stop-data,Stop Data,"In July 2019, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) implemented new data collection methods that enabled officers to collect more comprehensive information about each police stop in an aggregated manner. More specifically, these changes have allowed for more detailed data collection on stops, protective pat down (PPDs), searches, and arrests. (For a complete list of terms, see the glossary on page 2.) These changes support data collection requirements in the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Amendment Act of 2016 (NEAR Act).The accompanying data cover all MPD stops including vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle, and harbor stops for the period from July 22, 2019 to June 30, 2022. A stop may involve a ticket (actual or warning), investigatory stop, protective pat down, search, or arrest.If the final outcome of a stop results in an actual or warning ticket, the ticket serves as the official documentation for the stop. The information provided in the ticket include the subject’s name, race, gender, reason for the stop, and duration. All stops resulting in additional law enforcement actions (e.g., pat down, search, or arrest) are documented in MPD’s Record Management System (RMS). This dataset includes records pulled from both the ticket (District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles [DMV]) and RMS sources. Data variables not applicable to a particular stop are indicated as “NULL.” For example, if the stop type (“stop_type” field) is a “ticket stop,” then the fields: “stop_reason_nonticket” and “stop_reason_harbor” will be “NULL.” Each row in the data represents an individual stop of a single person, and that row reveals any and all recorded outcomes of that stop (including information about any actual or warning tickets issued, searches conducted, arrests made, etc.). A single traffic stop may generate multiple tickets, including actual, warning, and/or voided tickets. Additionally, an individual who is stopped and receives a traffic ticket may also be stopped for investigatory purposes, patted down, searched, and/or arrested. If any of these situations occur, the “stop_type” field would be labeled “Ticket and Non-Ticket Stop.” If an individual is searched, MPD differentiates between person and property searches. The “stop_location_block” field represents the block-level location of the stop and/or a street name. The age of the person being stopped is calculated based on the time between the person’s date ofbirth and the date of the stop.There are certain locations that have a high prevalence of non-ticket stops. These can be attributed to some centralized processing locations. Additionally, there is a time lag for data on some ticket stops as roughly 20 percent of tickets are handwritten. In these instances, the handwritten traffic tickets are delivered by MPD to the DMV, and then entered into data systems by DMV contractors. On August 1, 2021, MPD transitioned to a new version of its current records management system, Mark43 RMS.Due to this transition, the data collection and structures for the period between August 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021 were changed. The list below provides explanatory notes to consider when using this dataset.New fields for data collection resulted in an increase of outliers in stop duration (affecting 0.98% of stops). In order to mitigate the disruption of outliers on any analysis, these values have been set to null as consistent with past  practices.Due to changes to the data structure that occurred after August 1, 2021, six attributes pertaining to reasons for searches of property and person are only available for the first seven months of 2021. These attributes are: Individual’s Actions, Information Obtained from Law Enforcement Sources, Information Obtained from Witnesses or Informants, Characteristics of an Armed Individual, Nature of the Alleged Crime, Prior Knowledge. These data structure changes have been updated to include these attributes going forward (as of April 23, 2022).Out of the four attributes for types of property search, warrant property search is only available for the first seven months of 2021. Data structure changes were made to include this type of property search in future datasets.The following chart shows how certain property search fields were aligned prior to and after August 1, 2021. A glossary is also provided following the chart. As of August 2, 2022, these fields have reverted to the original alignment.https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/Explanatory%20Notes%202021%20Data.pdfIn October 2022 several fields were added to the dataset to provide additional clarity differentiating NOIs issued to bicycles (including Personal Mobility Devices, aka stand-on scooters), pedestrians, and vehicles as well as stops related specifically to MPD’s Harbor Patrol Unit and stops of an investigative nature where a police report was written. Please refer to the Data Dictionary for field definitions.Finally, MPD is conducting on-going data audits on all data for thorough and complete information. For Annual Reports and more information regarding police stops, please see: https://mpdc.dc.gov/stopdataFigures are subject to change due to delayed reporting, on-going data quality audits, and data improvement processes.",2020-07-21 18:59:58+00:00,

The sources of disease surveillance information include contact tracing, medical record review, and laboratory information, and are considered protected health information. When interpreting the results of these analyses, it is important to keep in mind that the disease surveillance system may not capture the full picture of the outbreak, and that previously reported data may change over time as it undergoes data quality review or as additional information is added. These analyses, especially within populations with small samples, may be subject to large amounts of variation from day to day.

		Common Questions Find More MAR Data Documentation Before the MAR The format and quality of address information varied considerably across government enterprise systems, making it nearly impossible to identify all of the activity associated with a given address. Police reports recorded by MPD likely contained different addressing formats than drivers licenses at the DMV. Address anomalies, which do not fit logically into the DC address grid, were never tracked or accounted for. We have all seen these types of locations such as even numbered addresses incorrectly found on odd side of streets. Benefits of MAR Now, addressing standards are built in. They define the valid components of DC addresses (Address Number, Street Name, Street Type, Quadrant), including their correct formatting and spelling. It also includes related datasets for intersections, blocks and points of interest for prominent locations. The data was assembled from years of research of more than 20 address databases, like the US Postal Service, and it continues to be updated daily. This allows District agencies to more easily compare address information across all databases. For example, the 911 call center uses the exact same addressing system as the Department of Energy &amp; Environment's storm water management teams. Tools and Development Quick Lookup The District created a nice, easy to use, website where anyone can search for a single address or square suffix lot. Just use one of our standard methods to get quick information. What Ward are you located in? What is your police district? What else? MAR Web Geocoder The MAR Web Geocoder is a web browser-based tool for geocoding locations, typically addresses, in Washington, DC. It is developed by the Office of Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and can input Excel or CSV files to output an Excel file. Data will be appended with geographic attributes from the District's Master Address Repository. Get started with the user guide. MAR Web Services The MAR 2 API and web services provide a variety of methods to perform geocoding and address verification. Developers can create single address lookup or batch processing through the MAR. The MAR 2 API provides RESTful services with json outputs while the Legacy MAR web services use SOAP services with xml and json outputs. Search Addresses Batch Geocoding Reverse Geocoding Find Zones MAR 2 APIAllows users to search for addresses, place names, blocks and intersections within the DC boundary. MAR 2 APIThe preferred method for the bulk geocoding of addresses over cycling through and locating each address in a list. MAR 2 APIUse latitude and longitude coordinates to reverse lookup nearby addresses and the zones they are contained by. MAR 2 APIGet information regarding associated boundaries like ANC, police district, census tract, and Ward. Legacy MAR Relate with Other Datasets It's easy to relate the MAR with datasets across DC government. The MAR is stored in an Oracle enterprise relational database with over 20 unique tables and linked to the Department of Transportation's street spatial database. Look for these common unique identifiers to relate with many of the datasets offered in Open Data DC. Use the desktop geocoder to assign ADDRESS_ID to your data and link up to the property layers below.

Property Lots in DC Common Questions Who is responsible for the MAR? The OCTO Data team which is part of the Office of the Chief Technology Officer is responsible for maintaining the MAR. The Department of Buildings (DOB) is responsible for approving new addresses. The DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) is responsible for maintaining certain information regarding streets. How are individual addresses verified? Many sources are checked during the address verification process. The more sources that recognize the candidate address, the more likely it will be added to the MAR. Below are some sources that are being used for address verification: Are there many cases of illogical addresses? Yes. There are dozens of addresses that are illogical. These are illogical because they do not follow the normal rules of Washington, DC's addressing grid system. These illogical addresses are also referred to as address anomalies. Learn more in the Address Anomalies report. The District continuously works to track down these cases and ensuring that the address database matches the reality on the street. How accurately mapped are the Address Records? The address records have a very high level of spatial accuracy. Address records should be located either at or near the center of the building or near the main entrance of the address. It is estimated that there are less than 70 addresses (~ .05%) that are not located within the correct building footprint. There has been a tremendous effort invested in ensuring a very high level of spatial accuracy. This allows for excellent point in polygon analysis.

		Common Questions DC Real Property Finder Recorded Lands and Taxation The Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) maintains a database known as the Integrated Tax System (ITS) containing the accounts for real estate property. ITS records property transactions, such as reconfigured lots &amp; ownership change, as they occur during a given fiscal year. DC government's fiscal year begin October 1st and ends September 30th. Below are the six different lot types in the District. Individually, these key layers make up most of the District's property boundaries. Together, they make up a single layer known as the common ownership lots and dimensions. Find More VPM Data Common Ownership Lots Considered a primary data set to begin working with. This polygon layer is built from the various lot types in the District. The common ownership dataset is conflated by Square, Suffix and Lot to include: Air Rights, Record, Parcel, Tax and Reservation lots. Some Parcels and Reservations fall outside of a Square’s boundary.  It does NOT include condominiums. Refer to the Condo Relate Table and Condo Approval Lot data. Documentation Vector Property Mapping (VPM) Vector property mapping data is recorded and maintained with the oversight of the Office of Chief Technology Officer (OCTO), Office of the Surveyor, and the Real Property Tax Administration (RPTA). The data you see here represents active lots as of September 1, 2006. Prior to this date, lot history was not created or property transactions have since been applied to keep the data current. If you're interested in lot history, these can still be found utilizing other publicly available resources such as the Office of the Surveyor’s SurDocs management system (Square cards, Plats, and miscellaneous documents), baist books, and property scans. Benefits of VPM Benefits of the VPM project extend from within District government to the public and private users of the data. Innovative use of geospatial technology continues to improve business processes of the three agencies that manage land records. The semi-automated subdivision and building plat production process creates a faster turnaround time for plats and constituent access. The extensive data depicts active citywide lots with the ability to display history and change of property over time. Condominium Approved Lots The Condo Approval Lots layer was created to assist you in identifying the relationship between ground surface lots, overlay lots and their associated condominiums. It helps users research the original source material recorded in the Office of the Surveyor and view their boundaries. Condo dwellings can also be found using the individual active record lots, dead air rights and tax lots where the value in the UNDERLIES_CONDO field is equal to 1. Approved for Ground When condos are approved for ground lots (aka, record lots), those remain in the condo approval layer. Its attributions are also updated to reflect them. The following fields are populated once condo lots have been approved: Approved for Overlay When condos are approved for overlay lots (aka, air rights and tax lots), those now become dead lots and archived to their respective history layer. Search for these by performing a query where the value in the UNDERLIES_CONDO field is equal to 1. Condo Relationships These tables are related based on the REGIME value and will help to quantify the number of condos residing on a lot - grouping of condos. The regime number starts with a 1, 2, or 3 depending upon where the condo is located and where they fall in the tax assessment process. All numbers after the first are consecutive. Use REGIME as a primary key between these tables. Tools and Development Property Web Services Web services are a series of APIs which primarily call DC Government’s MAR. These operations return a wealth of information about locations in Washington, DC offered as XML based returns (.NET and SOAP) and JSON. Great news! These APIs are freely available to all users, not just DC gov. By using the MAR web services, users can take advantage of DC's authoritative data sources including the best available source of addressing and street network.

Returns Addresses of Air Rights, Tax, Parcel, Record and Reservation lots associated with the input parcel and lot. Find More Web Services Integrated Tax Assessment Public Extract The tax assessment roll public extract (ITSPE) is used for assessment and property analysis, to send property tax bills and notices, and stores comprehensive tax information such as ownership, mailing addresses, non-contiguous Air Rights lots (Multifamily or Development), Air Rights lots, possessory interest lots, record lots, tax lots, parcels, condominiums, and federally owned lands such as reservations and appropriations. The linkage from the Vector Property layers to this database is SSL (Square, Suffix, and Lot). Considerations It should be noted that not all record lots have a direct 1:1 relationship to information in this database. The most obvious examples would be when a tax lot was created from existing record lots. In this case, only the tax lot would have linkage to the ITSPE, not the underlying record lots (though they still exist). Reservations that have been converted into tax lots are an additional example where the reservation still exists, however for taxation purposes the tax lot (overlay) supersedes and has corresponding linkage to ITS. The same is true for most Condominiums and the ground surface lot (Record) which still exist (common space) or the previous overlay (Air Right or Tax lot), only the Condo lot would have linkage to (ITSPE).

		Common Questions Methods There are two methods for creating new property boundaries. First, via the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affair's (DCRA) Surveyor's Office where they will generate a Subdivision upon request. Second, from OTR's Real Property Mapping and Assessment Division where they will generate Assessment &amp; Taxation Plats. The District maintains a history of lots as real estate transactions occur, such as sales or development. Ground Surface Lots These records and reservations are considered ground lots and can only be combined, subdivided, or killed by itself. It is why in most scenarios you can only obtain a building permit for record lots. Reservations were acquired by the Federal government by purchase, condemnation, dedication or as a gift. Almost all U.S. reservations are under the Jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Note that both may have superseding tax lots for land tracking purposes. The ""of-lot"" Process: A ground lot can also become an of-lot if and when there is an overlay that is being subdivided for development or sale. An of-lot is the D.C. Surveyor’s Office term for describing Remaining Part of Original Lot. Sometimes this is done to obtain permitting. If a value of 1 is in the OF_LOT_SEQ field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified. Typically, any of these of-lots will also have a tax lot overlapping them since it is a piece or remainder of a record lot. There are approximately 11,500 of-lots. History of Recorded Lands and Taxation A history of lot changes dating back to 2006. If you're interested in additional lot history, view other publicly available resources such as the Office of the Surveyor’s SurDocs management system (Square cards, Plats, and miscellaneous documents), Baist books, and property scan images. Zoning and Development The Zoning Commission is authorized to approve Planned Unit developments (PUD). The PUD process provides for higher quality development through flexibility in building controls, including height and density. Although assumes the result is superior to what would result from a matter-of-right development and offer a commendable number or quality of meaningful public benefits including – including protect and advance public health, safety, welfare, and convenience, and is not inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The Development Report is a summary of major development and construction projects. The Washington DC Economic Partnership (WDCEP) tracks these throughout the year and performs an annual “census” in the month of August. This research and outreach receives contribution from more than 100 developers, architects, contractors, and economic development organizations. This results in updates to 400 plus projects. Although every attempt is made to ensure the quality of the information contained in the report, WDCEP makes no warranty or guarantee as to its accuracy, completeness, or usefulness for any given purpose. Land Boundary Changes View land boundary changes and keep track of yearly change with the recorded date, RECORDATION_DT. This layer is derived from the Common Ownership Lots and represents property transactions as they’ve occurred since the implementation of the Vector Property Mapping program in September 2006. A property transaction entails new geometry (split/combination of Lot(s) or property type conversion (from Air Rights, Record, or Tax Lots to Condo lots). The layer contains locations and attributes of archived features (inactive lots – dead lots) and corresponds with OTR's Public Extract files (ITSPE). The data was created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the DC Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating DC government agencies (Office of the Surveyor (OS) &amp; Real Property Tax Administration (RPTA). The creation of this layer is automated. It occurs weekly for the current calendar year and geometry updated when a transaction occurs. Common Questions How can I access and view VPM data? These property data, along with hundreds of others, are all available for download here. When viewing the results for each page users are offered the option to open a preview in ArcGIS Online - a free map viewer. Just click Create Webmap from the About section. Other popular DC government apps for viewing are, What does cadastral mean and how is it related to VPM? DC's VPM data are referred to as a group of cadastral GIS layers. A cadstral map shows political and property boundaries as well as ownerhip of lands. How are addresses and a piece of property related? It is a many-to-many relationship where one lot can have multiple addresses on it. Think of downtown buildings with corner stores. Likewise, one structure with a single address could potentially cross two lots. Where can I find the property use type? The Property Use Code List Lookup domain table will identify the various use types. These codes appear as the USECODE field in many of DC's property layers. Is VPM data considered a legal field survey? Short answer, NO. This is very important. These are representations of property boundaries but should not be used for property line disputes. A licensed land surveyor is the only legal means of determining property boundaries. The VPM data in most cases will never be as accurate as a legal survey; it is difficult to maintain a dataset at that accuracy when you have over 180,000 properties city-wide and only about 7% have been field surveyed. Furthermore, cadastral maps provide an approximation of property location for taxing purposes. A land survey provides a legal document that is admissible in court. For boundary disputes questions/issues, individuals should contact DCRA's Office of Surveyor Services. If VPM is not legal, then how do I obtain a legal plat of my land? Depending on your needs you could obtain a deed through the Recorder of Deeds or a plat from Surveyor Services. Is VPM data perfect? Dare to dream. We think we do a pretty good job of capturing cadastral data in DC and we acknowledge that there are weaknesses. The data is not 100% real-time. There is a lag between the time it takes for a boundary change to be approved by DCRA or OTR, and how it makes its way into VPM. Also, square data is not tied to survey points.  Each square is a free floating entity and thus is a ""best-fit"" to ground level. There are no control points (x,y) for squares to tie them to real world coordinates. If you think your square and/or lot's placement can be ""better fit"" to its surrounding physical features such as buildings, please send and email to open.data@dc.gov. how can I identify what lot type each of the polygons are? In the Common Ownership Lots dataset, take a look at the LOT_TYPE attribute column of the data. This column contains a series of coded values identified below. For example, records lots are equal to 1. If you performed a filter such as LOT_TYPE=1 you'll find all the District's record lots. In the SSL identifier, how do I interpret the Lot numbers? SSL are 12 characters in length. The first 4 characters are your Square. The middle 4 characters, if present, are your Suffix and last 4 characters are your lot. Therefore, How are Suffix values formatted within a SSL identifier? Let's answer this using a series of ""if, then"" statements. SSL are 12 characters in length. The first 4 characters are your Square. The middle 4 characters, if present, are your Suffix and last 4 characters are your lot.

Aerial Imagery &amp; Orthophotography Preview and Compare Imagery The planning, detail and coordination between us, the United States government and other key partners are a great deal. Timing is everything in these projects. We always plan to fly in late winter when leaves haven't sprung yet and shadowing is minimal during the best time of day. However sometimes it just doesn't work out. This is why perhaps you'll see more obscure areas as shadows in some imagery, or too much leaf coverage. Nonetheless, the data we derive from these images are valuable to us and you! An Aerial History In the mid-1990's, before DC GIS, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and DC government departments teamed up to obtain aerial imagery for survey work. The resulting 1995 and 1999 images were used to support government operations in planning, property assessment and public works. The 1995 and 1999 aerial projects compiled the imagery at 1 foot resolution. For its time this was considered great detail. However in comparison, the city's two most recent flights captured images at 3 inch resolution. This means that for every pixel, we are providing you 3 inches of ground cover. Latest High Resolution Imagery The project was flown on March 11, 2021 at an average altitude of 3,000 feet. The aerial imagery acquisition was flown to support the creation of 4-band digital orthophotography with a 3 inch/0.08 meter pixel resolution over the full project area covering the District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square miles. The data are available as both JPEG2000 and a compressed geospatial SID file.

These foundational datasets are available from every year we completed an aerial flight project. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Captured in Winter, 2022 Browse all DC LiDAR LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the District's surface. The data collected is known as point cloud dataset which includes x, y, and z coordinates with additional details that can help classify landscape features. The z coordinates are what give us the three-dimensional space. The District of Columbia has published new LiDAR captured on January 24, 2022 with a short re-flight on January 26, 2022. The previous LiDAR effort was done in 2018, 2015 and 2020. The 2022 data includes vegetation classifications and building classifications. The DSM, DTM and nDSM are provided at 1 meter resolution.

Common Questions How often does DC government capture Orthophotography and LiDAR? We try to collect Orthophotography and update planimetric data every other year. As events in government progress we will do our best to keep our users informed. Follow us  @OpenDataDC on Twitter. What geographic projection are DC's aerial photos in? Most aerial photos are projected in Web Mercator, such as those highlighted on this page. However, the same images are also projected in Maryland State Plane NAD83. While DC's preferred projection is Maryland State Plane NAD83, we offer Web Mercator because it is widely used in the industry. How do I get the original GeoTIFF files as opposed to the compressed file? Yes of course! These files are quite large and can be several gigabytes of data. You will need to provide an external storage device such as a flash drive. Please reach out to DC GIS at dcgis@dc.gov so that we can work out the details.

Desktop Geocoder The MAR Geocoder is a desktop application that employs web services to assign a location in the form of geographic coordinates. Please note, this application is no longer supported. This means that although the geocoder is still available and generally continues to work for some users, we are no longer devoting resources to support bug fixes nor enhancements. Web Services The MAR 2 API and web services provide a variety of methods to perform geocoding and address verification. Developers can create single address lookup or batch processing through the MAR. The MAR 2 API provides RESTful services with json outputs while the Legacy MAR web services use SOAP services with xml and json outputs. Search Addresses Batch Geocoding Reverse Geocoding Find Zones MAR 2 APIAllows users to search for addresses, place names, blocks and intersections within the DC boundary.

		Common Questions Find More Roadway Data Documentation Making Roadway Data Better Centerline data has traditionally contained only information about the street itself. This is perfect for a lot of basic mapping tasks but problematic if you also need to know about the bike lanes or traffic volumes on the street. If you require an integrated view of data beyond what comes with the centerline data, an analysis is required combine these data into a unified dataset. The ""All-in-one"" roadway datasets below have been built to remove that burden. DC government has completely rebuilt its centerline datasets with two goals in mind: Choose Your Segmentation ""Flavor"" Data analysts at DDOT are ""chopping up,"" (segmenting) the roadway in a variety of styles to support a broad array of analyses. Whether you are a GIS analyst, performance analyst or one of our public users, there are wide ranges of potential uses: Whatever the analytical need, these segmentations should cover a majority of use cases: Roadway Block Roadway SubBlock Roadway Blockface Intersection Approach A block begins at a street-to-street intersection and ends at the next street-to-street intersection.  Blocks are a common way in which to organize and relate work. Although driveways or alleys may intersect streets, the Block segmentation requires that the segment remain unbroken. Represents the full extent of the DC centerline network &amp; contains every roadway type in DC roadway system. It is the finest-grained, 'base' segment from which all other segmentation patterns can be constructed (including Blocks). It is the original source of the DDOT Street Centerlines data. Unbroken sections of the curb. It can be made up of several subblocks, or one subblock. There are blockfaces on both sides of the road, each dependent on an unbroken length of curb. Blockfaceswill be the future home of parking zone summaries (in Development). Intersection Approach Segments are short segments of the route that approach an intersection - a short section of the road leading up to an intersection. Its purpose is to provide the network direction flow to the intersection point which may be important in analyses. Bike Infrastructure Pennsylvania Avenue Bike Lanes Pennsylvania Avenue Bike Lanes Contained within both Block and SubBlock segmentations are very detailed information about the bike infrastructure in DC. Conventional Bike Lanes are typically 5-feet wide with a bicycle symbol and arrow in the direction of travel with no physical separation to the adjacent parking and/or travel lane. Protected Bike Lanes are dedicated space for bicycling that is physically separated from automobile parking or traffic with posts, curbs or other type of vertical barrier. There are a total of 1,252 blocks in DC with a bike lane. Conventional Bike Lanes Total Bike Lanes Protected, Buffered Bike Lanes 73.7 miles 90.7 miles 17 miles Source: Roadway SubBlocks Source: Roadway SubBlocks Source: Roadway SubBlocks Roadway Characteristics There are potentially millions of different roadway configurations. DDOT's roadway segmentations capture an amazing amount of detail and provide useful summaries on over 50 different roadway characteristics: The Roadway Blocks dataset is packed with interesting roadway characteristics. These are just a few. Downtown DC Intersection Downtown DC Intersection Highway Performance and Classification In addition to configurations, the LRS now consolidates performance metrics such as annual average daily traffic volume, international roughness indexes and pavement condition indexes. Find both Federal and DC government classifications for road types or whether a particular segment is a DDOT snow plow route.

Tools and Development MAR Web Services The MAR API and Web Services provide a variety of methods to perform geocoding and address verification. Developers can create single address lookup or batch processing through the MAR. The MAR 2 API provides RESTful services with json outputs while the Legacy MAR uses SOAP services with xml and json outputs. Common Questions What is LRS? All of the data mentioned above comes from DDOT's Linear Referencing System (or LRS).  This is an enterprise system which helps consolidate and manage each GIS centerline and the roadway characteristics related to them. Read more here. What is Cross-section data? DDOT has captured the cross-sectional data for every roadway in DC.  It's extremely detailed and is fast becoming one of the key roadway analysis datasets.   Nearly half of the Roadway segmentation attributes come from summarizations of cross-section data. Read more here. What happens to the historic street centerline datasets? For over 20 years, the District has maintained and published centerline data in a variety of (now) legacy systems. While these datasets contained good information, the maintenance and publishing these data were extremely time-consuming and difficult.  These challenges led us to implement the new system we have today. Below are datasets that previously published from older systems, but can now be found in the new data, as follows: SubBlock Block SubBlock SubBlock Block SubBlock Intersection Block Intersection For all intersections regardless of road type, use Subblock Intersection For street-to-street intersections, use Block Intersection Block Block Block Block SubBlock Block SubBlock Block Block Keep Up with Our Work Take an active interest in Open Data DC.

		Common Questions DC Public Lands Finder Where are Government Properties? District Government Land (Owned, Operated, and or managed) Frequently updated as transactions occur. Our primary dataset for government related properties to be used by many DC Government agencies, private companies and the public. It supports the daily business process of District agencies that originate and manage land records. Transfers of Jurisdiction (TOJ) are also in this layer. Find More Data Documentation Federal vs District The Federal and District Government transfer properties in title, right of use, conveyances, and condemnation, known as Transfers of Jurisdiction (TOJ). The transfers involve all lot types and the reservation which was the original transfer may now have superseding lots. These records can be queried from the NARRATIVE field using a ""like"" statement for “TOJ”. It can also be found and queried in the District owned layer’s COMMENT field. Benefits of this Dataset The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) has created a centralized map viewer, Public Lands in DC, that can be consumed by other web products with mapping capability or within web pages. It is considered the best master list of District assets and TOJs where interested parties have one place to view and update property data. Also, properties can be reviewed for compliance with various city ordinances. Two recent on-going efforts include, research and capture of all TOJ’s recorded in Office of Surveyor and creating highway plan and public easement layers. District Agency Coordination The Office of Tax and Revenue's Real Property Tax Administration is responsible for property assessments, ownership and address changes, tax billings, tax relief program administration, and land recordation for real property in the District of Columbia. The District’s assets, in coordination with RPTA, could be broken into four groups to better manage information, track developed properties and future acquisitions.

Common Ownership Lots Considered a primary data set to begin working with. This polygon layer is built from the various lot types in the District. The common ownership dataset is conflated by Square, Suffix and Lot to include: Air Rights, Record, Parcel, Tax and Reservation lots. Some Parcels and Reservations fall outside of a Square’s boundary.  It does NOT include condominiums. Refer to the Condo Relate Table and Condo Approval Lot data. Common Questions How do District agencies collaborate to update public lands data? District of Columbia agencies continuously work to update properties as transactions occur however recognize opportunities for improvement. The recent Public Lands Act shows how coordination may improve the District’s ability to enter into more cooperative management agreements with the National Park Service. Franklin Park is an example. It is not a transfer of any sort but is a tool that the District and the NPS can utilize in efforts to co-manage parks in the city. The General Services Administration (GSA) would be another participating Federal Agency. How complete is the District Government Lands (Owned, Operated or Managed) data? It should not be considered comprehensive and there are opportunities for improvement. The District Owned, Operated, Managed Properties can be compared with data in Archibus, CARSS, ITS and is a consolidated layer of all District properties/assets and some locations managed by DGS portfolio division. Quarterly updates may make the most sense to keep the information as up-to-date some District Agencies sell the property once developed. There are additional features not related to Property Lots, have no Square Suffix Lot (SSL) and part of the Right-of-Way. 16th street medians and DPW Mowing locations are two examples.

		Common Questions Web Map Services ArcGIS REST APIs You don't need specialized GIS software to consume DC's map services. They are easily accessed within web browsers or custom applications. The data layers you see individually in Open Data DC, are also published as a ArcGIS REST API endpoints. We do our best to organize them into themes or initiatives. Get Started To successfully use the ArcGIS REST API, you must understand how to construct a URL and interpret the response. All resources and operations exposed by the ArcGIS Services portion of the REST API are accessible through a hierarchy of endpoints for each GIS service published within DC's ArcGIS Server. Using Google Maps JS API Web Map Using Google Maps JS API Using Mapbox JS and JQuery Web Map Using Mapbox Use in Multiple Platforms Build it once and use it multiple ways. All the REST endpoints can be used across platforms. This Nearest Bike Share map using Mapbox JS and JQuery is an example of the same Capital Bike Share layer in ArcGIS.com.

Tableau Dev Tools This article describes how to connect Tableau to an Esri ArcGIS Server and set up the data source. The connector also supports connections via GeoService API. Common Questions What geographic projection are DC's map services in? Most map services are projected in Web Mercator, such as those highlighted on this page. However, there are a few that are projected in Maryland State Plane NAD83. While DC's preferred projection is Maryland State Plane NAD83, we offer Web Mercator because it is widely used in the industry. Is there a place where I can look up a single address quickly? Use the DC MAR API sample viewer to perform single address, intersection, block or place name search. Here you can find details such as the Ward, Census Tract and Police District a location falls in. There is more! In most searches you will also have the option to view a preview map. What if the location services do not find an address I know exists? We have an online form where you may submit said location for review; however, it needs to meet probable criteria. Start by searching in the Master Address Repository. For example, if you search for  296 I Street SE you’ll find this address does not exist AND an web form link will appear at the bottom of the page. This address is possible since there is a 200 block of I Street SE. A search for 10096 I Street SE is not possible; there is no 10000 block of I Street SE and therefore no web link will appear. Do you have standards for using DC Web Services? Great question! We appreciate your consideration of this and ask that you read web services best practices for some tips.

		Common Questions Let's get Started Or follow the quick start guide below... How much of an introduction do you need? An application programming interface (API) is an interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. DC gov uses APIs as a means to serve data to its developer community. Learn More Find the Data Think of a keyword and enter it in the search box. Suggested keyword searches will appear as you begin typing. DC tags its layers with words we think will match your expected results. Field Attribute Preview Each data layer in the catalog comes with a brief description that helps give context. You will also see a publication date and boxes identifying attribute fields within the data. The Data tab at the top will show a preview of the table. Let's take a look at Building Energy Performance as an example. The Data tab will show you the preview table.

See something missing in the above technologies? Comment at Welcome to Issues, or share in our Ways to Contribute. Common Questions Is there a bulk API available? All data is available for bulk download as CSV. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to chunk the CSV files for easier download. To get the direct link to the CSV, just copy the URL for the GeoJSON and replace .geojson with .csv. What is the difference between GeoJSON and Esri JSON? Both are valid JSON representations of earth-based geometries and the information attached to them. GeoJSON is more widely used in open source projects, while Esri JSON is mostly used in the widely distributed Esri products. However, it’s important to note that more and more Esri products are outputting GeoJSON, and accepting GeoJSON inputs. GeoJSON specifications is actually not bad reading for a document of this sort. But if you want something more entertaining, try Tom MacWright’s ""More than you ever wanted to know about geojson."" Here is the Esri JSON documentation: https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/. Esri provides some open source tools to work between the two formats: https://github.com/Esri/geojson-utils.

		Common Questions Introducing MAR 2 API MAR 2 API Data Developer's Portal The Master Address Repository (MAR) 2 API is a new version of web services built on a modern code framework and provides output in modern data interchange format. It uses additional technology stacks to provide greater stability, enhanced response, and more flexibility. We encourage all our users to begin testing with MAR 2 API and of course build any new application with it, rather than Legacy MAR. The MAR 2 API is a modern .NET geocoding web service that utilizes ElasticSearch and an API Key to perform geocoding requests against MAR attributes and associated geometries. This portal provides developers with the ability to create user profiles, manage API Keys, review API guides, view code examples for MAR 2 API. The MAR 2 API is currently at version: 2.2 (September 2022) Data Developer's Portal Use these for all your new application development! Location Viewer Perform a single address lookup and display associated attributes. Batch Geocoding The new MAR Web Geocoder is a web browser-based tool used for geocoding locations, such as addresses, in Washington, DC. It operates by uploading Excel or CSV files to enrich your data with DC geographic characteristics such as Wards, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, ownership lots, zip codes, longitude and latitude and more. It has built-in quality control checks that review your data for completeness and utilizes look-up tables for alternative names, abbreviations, and misspellings. The geocoder will append the information and deliver it as a downloadable Excel file – all adhering to the District’s addressing standards. For a full list of available geographic characteristics, read the MAR Web Geocoder user guide. Legacy MAR Web Services Legacy MAR web services have been around for many years. It is stable and has reached its maturity where we are no longer developing with it. Legacy MAR is not going away anytime soon, but we are asking developers to start testing their applications with MAR 2 API. Use MAR 2 API for all of your new applications! Example Web Service Operations Many tools exist for interfacing with Legacy MAR web services including Postman and SoapUI. We use Postman in some of the examples below.  It's an easy to use, free, and open source application with both web app and desktop application options. Below is a walk through of how to POST a request to the Legacy MAR web services followed by example operations.

The above dashboard shows the total number of children and families served cumulatively during the month. Specifically, it shows the total number of children served throughout the month, or all of the children who are still in foster care as of the last day of the month and any children who had exited foster care prior to the end of the month (and in foster care for at least one day).

		Amendment Mayor's Order 2017-115 I. Purpose 1. This Order establishes a comprehensive data policy for the District government. 2. The data created and managed by the District government are valuable assets and are independent of the information systems in which the data reside. As such, the District government shall: 3. The greatest value from the District’s investment in data can only be realized when enterprise datasets are freely shared among District agencies, with federal and regional governments, and with the public to the fullest extent consistent with safety, privacy, and security. “Shared” means that enterprise datasets shall be: 4. By so sharing, the District can: 5. Because inappropriate disclosure of personal information and misuse of data for activities such as identity theft are significant concerns, the District’s data must also be managed and responsibly protected. To protect the safety, privacy, and security of residents, workforce members, clients, partners, stakeholders, visitors, and others, datasets requiring protection shall be identified and: II. Scope III. Definitions In this policy, the following definitions apply: Agency Data Officer (ADO) Means an employee, designated by an agency head, who, in coordination with the CDO, helps ensure that the agency is implementing this policy. Agency Information Security Officer (AISO) Means an employee designated by a District agency head or an OCTO employee, who is responsible for coordinating with the CISO to implement, manage, monitor, and report on cyber security for their assigned agency. Automated-anonymization-aggregation-generalization-redaction The process of creating a new derivative dataset that can be a lower-level dataset classification for more open distribution through a straightforward and repeatable automated processes. Chief Data Officer (CDO) Means the senior official reporting to the CTO who has overall responsibility for the District’s data governance processes, including the collection, creation, maintenance, documentation, dissemination, and archiving of high-quality, highly interoperable datasets. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Means the senior official reporting to the CTO who has overall responsibility for the District’s information security strategy and practices. Chief Performance Officer means the chief performance officer of the District government, a position within the Office of the City Administrator. Chief Technology Officer Means the agency director of OCTO. Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication (CC0) Means a license developed by Creative Commons that allows others to freely build on, enhance, and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law. Creative Commons is a nonprofit international organization that creates standard copyright licenses for use by governments and other bodies to give the public permission to share and use creative work. Data Means a subset of information, whether quantitative or qualitative, that is regularly maintained by, created by or on behalf of, and owned or licensed by a public body in non-narrative, alphanumeric, or geospatial formats. Data are an asset independent of the systems or formats in which they reside. Dataset Means a collection of data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way. Typically, a dataset consists of one or more tables and is stored in a database or spreadsheet. Files of the following types are not datasets: text documents, emails, messages, videos, recordings, image files such as designs, diagrams, drawings, photographs, and scans, and hard-copy records. Dataset Classification Level 0, Open Refers to all enterprise datasets that do not fall within the definitions of level 1, 2, 3, or 4. For example, certificates of occupancy are determinations by the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) that the use of a building, structure, or land in the District conforms to zoning regulations and building codes. This dataset would not be designated by DCRA as Level 1, 2, 3, or 4 and therefore would be considered Level 0. Moreover, any dataset regularly published in machine-readable format on opendata.dc.gov or another dc.gov website prior to this Order is considered “Level 0, Open” unless an agency makes a proactive determination to raise the classification. Level 1, Public Not Proactively Released Refers to a dataset that is not protected from public disclosure or subject to withholding under any law (including FOIA), regulation, or contract. Nevertheless, publication of the dataset on the public Internet and exposure to search engines would: Level 2, For District Government Use Refers to a dataset that the originating agency determines is subject to one or more FOIA exemptions, is not highly sensitive, and may be distributed within the District government without restriction by law, regulation, or contract. For example, OCTO licenses commercial data on businesses operating in the District. The license prohibits the public distribution of the data, and proprietary restrictions qualify as a FOIA exemption. Nevertheless, the data has widespread utility within the government, including for economic development and emergency management, and therefore would be classified as Level 2. Level 3, Confidential Refers to a dataset that the originating agency has determined is protected from disclosure by law, including FOIA, regulation, or contract and that is either highly sensitive or is lawfully, regulatorily, or contractually restricted from disclosure to other public bodies. Such datasets generally include datasets that contain data that qualifies for designation by a federal agency or District agency as: Level 4, Restricted Confidential Refers to datasets for which the originating agency has determined that unauthorized disclosure could potentially cause major damage or injury, including death, to residents, agency workforce members, clients, partners, stakeholders, or others identified in the information, or otherwise significantly impair the ability of the agency to perform its statutory functions. Includes any dataset designated by a federal agency at the level “Confidential” or higher under the federal government’s system for marking classified information. District of Columbia Internal Data Catalog (Internal Catalog) Means a District government intranet-accessible web portal that is centrally managed, hosted, and funded and has capabilities similar to the District of Columbia Open Data Catalog but which is open only to District government employees and which facilitates interagency data sharing. District of Columbia Open Data Catalog (Open Catalog) Means a publicly accessible web portal that helps members of the public find, understand, and utilize enterprise datasets. Districtwide Domain Tables Means database tables and services designated by the CDO that provide a standard source of values to be used across District information systems and data transformations. For example, the CDO could designate a table as containing the official list of agency names and abbreviations and promote use of the table by other systems. View Domain Tables. Enterprise Dataset Enterprise Dataset Inventory Means a listing of datasets of all public bodies, including each enterprise dataset’s designated classification level and justification for that designation and other limited metadata elements for each dataset. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Means the Freedom of Information Act of 1976, effective March 25, 1977 (D.C. Law 1-96; D.C. Official Code § 2-531 et seq.). FOIA provides that any person has the right to request access to records. Under FOIA, all public bodies of the District government are required to disclose public records, except for those records, or portions of records, that are protected from disclosure by the exemptions found at D.C. Code Official § 2-534. Information Means all records, narrative and non-narrative, managed by the District. Metadata Means a description of an enterprise dataset, such as date of creation or last update; author, maintainer, or point of contact; a dictionary to support the correct interpretation of data; and documentation of methodology or business rules. Originating Agency Means the District agency that compiles and manages the dataset in its original form, or on whose behalf the compiling and management is done. Open Government Advisory Group (OGAG) Means a committee of District government employees and public representatives established by Mayor’s Order 2016-094, issued June 9, 2016, to provide advice on transparency, open data, and open government. Subjective Redaction Means the process of creating a derivative dataset at a lower-level classification for more open distribution through a process that require humans or artificial intelligence to review the dataset each time the dataset is requested. IV. Personnel and Roles A. Chief Information Security Officer The CTO shall appoint a CISO for the District government who has the full delegated authority of the CTO for all matters pertaining to information security for the District.

Read the full document for the complete process including metadata and data dictionary standards. An initial version, released in 2018, is available here. Background Data Submission Process Data Curation Summary Diagram The Data program works as a partner to an agency throughout the process. The communication between the teams is key as the data originator shares the meaning and structure of the data while OCTO ensures it is published and distributed as intended. The process provides an overall framework to promote consistency and standardization within data warehousing and GIS databases, depending on the type of data being provided. It provides a well-documented dataset that can be utilized by DC agencies or the public via direct database queries, downloads, or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). DC’s data submission process involves five steps generally summarized below. Universal Request The program receives requests for data publication from multiple points of contact. The intake process is centralized using OCTOhelps ServiceNow IT Service Management platform.  Requests are received as Universal Requests (UR) and are assigned to the appropriate OCTO group. Data originators are directed to octohelps.dc.gov to initiate the process with basic information on the dataset under the GIS and Data Services category. Preparation After completing a universal request, the data analyst will work with the data originator to build a Data Curation Packet (DCP). This is maintained by the data analyst, but useful in conveying all necessary components below: Consultation The data analyst will thoroughly review the data curation packet’s information, specifications, requirements, and sample data before initiating the third step – consultation. First, the data discovery form is proof-read for completion and comprehension for a non-technical audience. Complex narratives should be moved to supplemental documentation. Then, the data dictionary is evaluated against the data sample to ensure descriptions, aliases, and coded domain values are present. Next, the data sample is evaluated against the program’s dataset rules. If applicable, the data mapping document is reviewed to ensure proper transformations are applied. The data analyst will then request a consultation and deliver feedback. Together they review the quality of the data, obtain approvals if needed, finalize submission requirements, and finish documentation. The data analyst will confirm the data meets the classification Level 0: Open as defined by the DC Data Policy. If there is uncertainty in classification, then the originator is referred to the agency’s General Counsel. Often the consultation can determine that more work is needed by the agency before the dataset can move to curation. Curation This step involves building the database schema, tables, views, indexes, and other related entities.  This process begins in lower environments to ensure accuracy and success before moving to production. Furthermore, data analysts will, Publication The datasets are published to production databases where they can be accessed more broadly by the DC government GIS and business intelligence user-base. Public datasets are then published as map services on the District’s ArcGIS Server stack. Map services allow cloud and desktop applications to access the most recent dataset via ArcGIS REST endpoints and on Open Data DC as commonly used open formats via APIs, including, GeoJSON, OGS WMS, and GeoServices. All map services are published using ArcGIS Pro. To publish a map service, Once the dataset is published on ArcGIS Server and Open Data DC, this completes the submission process. Note: raster datasets such as orthophotography and LiDAR are published on the District's ArcGIS Image Server at https://imagery.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services. These datasets undergo unique curation processes in coordination with licensed vendors. Maintenance A periodic review of published datasets will occur as structure changes and technology enhancements. The review will go through the same process as a new universal request using information from the initial request. Published datasets may also become obsolete or dated, at which point archiving the dataset will be an option. The Data program will review archiving options with the data originator. If authorized, the dataset will be included in the Data program’s archive with a note added to the metadata. Dataset Classification Datasets published on Open Data DC must adhere to the Dataset Classification standards provided in the DC Data Policy. Specifically, a dataset that would otherwise meet the definitions of Level 1, 2, 3, or 4 data cannot be published via Open Data DC. An agency must make a proactive determination to prepare a dataset for public release. This would involve ensuring that none of the elements in the dataset would not collectively classify it as Level 1, 2, 3, or 4. The modification to datasets classified at Level 1, 2, 3, or 4 must remove all elements that fall under the definition of those dataset classification levels to make them Level 0, Open.  This can be achieved by entirely removing those data elements which make them above Level 0 or using data anonymization tools that allow for the data elements to be modified of changed via techniques such as masking or applied algorithms for which the data cannot be reconstituted or used in coordination with other datasets to restore it to its previous classification levels. These changes should be made in agreement with agency general counsel. Changes in elements contained in a dataset previously classified according to the Dataset Classification section of the DC Data Policy would require it undergo classification once more.

		CDO Reports Enterprise Dataset Inventory 2023 Enterprise Dataset Inventory 2023 How did agencies classify datasets in 2023? Level 0, Open Refers to all enterprise datasets that do not fall within the definitions of level 1, 2, 3, or 4. For example, certificates of occupancy are determinations by the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) that the use of a building, structure, or land in the District conforms to zoning regulations and building codes. This dataset would not be designated by DCRA as Level 1, 2, 3, or 4 and therefore would be considered Level 0. Moreover, any dataset regularly published in machine-readable format on opendata.dc.gov or another dc.gov website prior to this Order is considered “Level 0, Open” unless an agency makes a proactive determination to raise the classification. The DC Data Policy also lays out a dataset classification system to help determine which enterprise datasets should be open to the public and which should be closed to protect privacy, safety, and security. Classifications were submitted by each Agency Data Officer and approved by a General Counsel. In 2023, agencies tagged 752 datasets as containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Read more about classification. In 2023, agencies were asked to review previous datasets and mark whether they included race or ethnicity characteristics. Background What is ""Open by Default?"" The District's data policy states that “enterprise datasets shall be open by default, meaning their existence will be publicly acknowledged, and further, if enterprise datasets are not shared, an explanation for restricting access will be publicly provided.” In other words, “open by default” means that although the District has many datasets that it cannot share, we should not have any that we will not inform the public of. Agency Participation The annual dataset inventory continues to show consistent participation from Mayoral and many independent agencies. The 2023 inventory recorded 2,204 enterprise datasets, up from 2,164 datasets in 2022. This year's inventory includes a restructuring of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA), which ceased to exist as of October 1, 2022, and then split into two separate agencies - the Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection (DLCP). As a result, both DOB and DLCP only have datasets for FY 2023.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::dc-forest-action-plan,DC Forest Action Plan,"DC State Forest Action Plan Assessment of Urban Forest Resources and Strategy Assessment of Urban Forest Resources and Strategy Learn more about: Forest conditions and trends Threats to forest lands and resources Priority issues and areas Urban Forest strategy Conditions and Trends Current Conditions Washington DC has many tracts of continuous forested area, providing opportunities for diverse ecosystems including Rock Creek Park, Palisades Parkway, the C&amp;O Canal National Historical Park and Fort Dupont. Common DC wildlife includes bald eagles, bats, coyotes, deer, ducks, eastern box turtles, eastern cottontails, foxes, owls, woodchucks and more. Washington DC straddles two ecoregions, the Piedmont and the Southeast Plains ecoregion. The dominant native vegetation on most of the well-drained loamy soil of the Piedmont is deciduous forest, and the native vegetation for the Southeast Plains in the District is mostly hardwoods with some softwoods. Located at the confluence of two rivers, Washington DC is a subtropic climate zone characterized by hot, humid summers and cold winters. Between 1981 and 2019, Washington DC’s median annual rainfall was almost 40 inches, with May and July being the wettest months. Expected climate change With slow warming trends in the air and water, it is expected that storms, such as nor’easters, that are created by mixing of high and low temperature air, and hurricanes, that are formed by combining warm water and humid air, will increase in frequency and/or magnitude. Based on scenarios developed by the DOEE and using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the USACE, water levels for the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers is expected to increase by 3.4 foot by 2080. This increase will put the District and many of its residents at greater risk for coastal flooding in the future. DOEE, using NOAA data, has projected that by the 2080s, the average summer temperature in Washington DC will be between 93- and 97-degrees Fahrenheit and the number of heat emergencies (days when the heat index reaches 95 degrees Fahrenheit or above) will increase to 40-75 days annually. The increase in heat and irregularities and changes in precipitation will put further stress on DC’s urban forest. Projected impacts of climate change on forests may lead to shifts in timing of budburst and flowering, changes in forest community structure and productivity (IPCC). Climate change may also result in increased disturbances such as pest outbreaks and extreme weather events, which may lead to mortality. Current State and Threats to the District’s Urban Forest DC's Urban Forest Washington DC’s urban forest is managed by the District’s Urban Forestry Division. The mission of UFD is to manage and increase the District's street trees to maintain healthy trees that provide improved air quality, increased groundwater retention that minimizes runoff and flooding, temperature moderation, aesthetics, and other benefits to the community. UFD does this by providing comprehensive urban forest management services across all public lands. Such services include tree planting, pruning, removal and inspection. In addition, UFD provides educational outreach and technology transfer to District residents regarding the benefits of urban trees, proper tree care techniques and other forest health-related information. This is all done with the goal of managing and increasing DC’s public trees and creating a healthy and robust tree canopy. Washington DC’s Urban Forestry Division is housed within the District’s Department of Transportation and is charged with managing the approximately 200,000 trees in the public space, which includes trees within public rights of way such as tree boxes, continuous planting strips, medians, and traffic circles. The Urban Forestry Division also provides stewardship for trees growing on other public lands, such as public parks, libraries, and schools. DC Urban Heat Islands Urban Forest Threats Washington DC is primarily an urban environment. The biggest threat to Washington DC’s forest are pressures associated with urban environments. Factors such as the urban heat island effect, limited and degraded soil volumes, and development can all contribute to the declining health of trees. This can include reduced growth, a shorter lifespan and increased susceptibility to pests. Pests and Pathogens One of the most persistent threats to the urban forest is non-native pests and pathogens. The unintentional introduction of these non-native species is typically a result of economic activity and may occur with nursery stock, produce or other similar products. The Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer and redbay ambrosia beetle are all examples of non-native invasive forest pests. Foreign pests and pathogens can increase tree mortality and can cause canopy thinning or dieback, growth loss, defoliation, and decreased reproduction or regeneration. Climate change may exacerbate these impacts. Changes in seasonal temperature and an increase in severe weather events can impact trees’ development and survivability, making them more susceptible to both native and non-native pests and pathogens. Additionally, warming trends may accelerate insect development rate and their natural mobility may expand their impact on forest environments. Priority Issues Priority Issue 1: Expand, Preserve and Improve the Urban Forest Sub-issue 1: Increase Urban Tree Canopy across all Ownership In Washington, D.C. the Urban Forestry Division (UFD) is the governing body primarily responsible for managing the urban forest in the public space. They are charged with tasks such as planting, pruning, removing, and maintaining the health of the District’s tree canopy, all with the goal of helping the District reach its 40 percent tree canopy goal. They manage approximately 175,000 street trees as well as trees on DC parkland and recreational properties. According to land cover analyses performed with support from the US Forest Service, street trees make up ~9 percent of the District's overall tree canopy. Sub-issue 2: Protect and Improve Environmental Health The interconnectedness of the environment means that a healthy tree canopy supports the health of the overall environment and those living in it. In an urban setting, this is especially important because the air purification and water filtration that trees provide not only impacts local wildlife, but it also impacts the health of the city’s residents. Sub-issue 3: Expand Resiliency Across the District using Urban Forestry Urban Heat Island Effect
		Heat islands are described by the US EPA as urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than outlying areas as a result of structures, such as buildings, roads and other infrastructure, absorbing and re-emitting the sun’s heat more than natural landscapes. It is referred to as the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI) because it is prevalent in urban areas. There are five main strategies for combating the UHI: increasing tree and vegetative cover, installing green roofs, installing cool roofs, installing reflective or permeable pavements, and utilizing smart growth practices. Flooding/flood preventionTrees are the original green infrastructure and used in conjunction with other bioretention facilities are able to trap large amounts of stormwater. Using green infrastructure techniques and planting and maintaining trees can mitigate flooding in riparian zones, MS4 areas and 100- and 500-year floodplains. Mitigate Climate ChangeA 2015 i-Tree Ecosystem Analysis (i-Tree Eco) found that the District’s tree canopy provided the following benefits:● Pollution removal: 619 tons/year ($26.0 million/year)● Carbon storage: 649,000 tons ($46.2 million)● Carbon sequestration: 26,700 tons/year ($1.90 million/year)● Oxygen production: 42,700 tons/year ($0 /year)● Avoided runoff: 42,386,000 cubic feet/year ($2.82 million/year)● Building energy savings: $705 thousand/year● Avoided carbon emissions: $168 thousand/year● Structural values: $4.28 billion Sub-issue 4: Management for a More Resilient Forest Climate Adaptation
		Trees build resiliency in a city, but the urban forest itself must also be climate resilient. To create a forest that can withstand the inevitable impacts of climate change, two actions should be taken: new trees must be thoughtfully planted, putting the right tree in the right place, and proactive management to mitigate risk to residents and the forest at large. Pest Control, Disease Prevention
		The urban forest is productive as long as the trees remain healthy. Protecting trees from pests and disease maintains both a healthy canopy and a productive urban ecosystem. In some areas of Washington DC, streets are lined with even-aged tree cohorts, which may be limited to one species. These nicely canopied avenues are striking to observe and enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. However, such low diversity in species and age puts these areas at risk to potential introductions of non-native pests and pathogens. Urban Forest CompositionAs the climate continues to change, the Urban Forestry Division, as managers of the Districts urban forest, must adjust their tree planting and maintenance strategies to ensure that the forest is not just managed for the people, but for long term growth. More intense extreme heat days and strong weather events put significant strain on DC’s urban forest and in response UFD will limit planting of common trees such as sugar maple and emphasize planting of more resilient tree species, including the Shumard oak which is tolerant of heat and drought. Existing trees, such as the hackberry can stand up to the changing climate as it is tolerant of drought and other environmental stressors. Today, UFD uses more than 125 species and varieties. Diversifying tree species creates a more hardy tree canopy and increases the urban forest’s resiliency to pest and disease. Priority Issue 2: Cultivate an Urban Forest that is Equitable, Inclusive and Accessible Sub-issue 1: Build Urban and Community Forestry Program Capacity Sub-issue 2: Make Urban Forest Benefits Accessible As the “City of Trees”, Washington DC has an extensive urban forest. However, in a 2018 survey about the District’s urban forest 89 percent of respondents said that they think the District needs more trees and 56 percent specified street trees as an area that needs higher canopy. The urban forest provides many different benefits that support a community’s social, environmental, and economic wellbeing. However, limited access to the urban forest can prevent neighborhoods from experiencing these benefits. Priority Issue 3: Multi-State Priority Areas Sub-Issue 1: Mid-Atlantic Shared Stewardship Sub-issue 2: Interjurisdictional Coordination in Urban Forestry Urban forestry is a vital component to livable, well-planned communities, which are also important to open space conservation. An urban tree canopy reduces stormwater runoff, particularly during the smaller rains that are most frequent and often carry high concentrations of pollutants. Based on current models, trees that overlap impervious areas tend to have greater ability to mitigate stormwater. Urban tree canopy also has the side benefit of decreasing air temperatures to improve air quality. Despite being in different forestry regions, the different jurisdictions within the DC metropolitan area works closely to coordinate environmental and forestry activity. The District’s Urban Forestry Division (UFD) works collaboratively with District, local, and regional organizations to create consistency and agreement in forest management.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2020 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2010 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area.",2021-08-31 13:27:00+00:00,

Any tree with a trunk greater than 100” in circumference is called a heritage tree. Heritage trees may only be removed if considered hazardous by a city arborist, otherwise, heritage trees cannot be removed, topped, girdled, or destroyed.If a heritage tree is within the limits of disturbance of a construction project, then they need to be properly protected throughout construction.

We want you to make the most of these shared investments by putting them to frequent use. We make these available you. But, we also need to protect our shared investments and make sure that we are using them in ways that do not impact others’ ability to use them.

		Common Questions Aggressive Scraping? Over the past few years, we’ve seen a sharp increase in the proliferation of bots and scrapers. These are applications that crawl web pages and services to extract information. Many of them are harmless, and some are even beneficial (e.g., Google’s bot helps our pages show up in search results).  But poorly-coded bots and scrapers can hurt the performance of the site/service they’re crawling by mimicking what is known as a Denial-of-Service attack, in which a web site is so overrun by traffic that it freezes and can’t respond to normal user interaction. Most of the aggressive scraping we see are with our MAR Web Services. Are you aggressively scraping a web service? If your application is accessing a service or page thousands of times with no pause in between, then your code can impact the operation of our web servers. We are especially concerned if the impact occurs during DC business hours (8:00 am to 6:00 pm EST) as our web services are used in many core business operations, both within District government and outside. Avoid Aggressive Scraping Generally, these bot and scraper best practices will mitigate impacts on Open Data DC servers: We monitor these services and take action to make sure that they remain available to all so that we protect our shared investment. If we see use of our services in a way that meets the above description of “aggressive” then we may block your operation from completing and/or your IP address from making further calls.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::existing-land-use,Existing Land Use,"A generalized dataset of existing land use in the District of Columbia as existed during its most recent extract of the common ownership lots. This dataset is different from the Comprehensive Plan - Future Land Use, which shows land use as envisioned in the latest version of DC’s Comprehensive Plan. The primary land use categories used in this dataset are similar, but not identical. The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) compared two datasets to create this generalized existing land use data. The data source identifying property use is the Property Use Code Lookup from the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR). An index provided by the Office of Planning assigns each OTR property use code with a “primary land use” designation. Through an automated process, the common ownership lots were then joined with this index to create the Existing Land Use. Only properties with an assigned use code from OTR are categorized. Other properties without a use code were left as NULL. Many of these tend to be public lands such as national parks. Refer to https://opendata.dc.gov/pages/public-lands.This dataset has no legal status and is intended primarily as a resource and informational tool.

https://datahub-dc-dcgis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::emissions-inventory,Emissions Inventory,"NEI point sources include emissions estimates for larger sources that are located at a fixed, stationary location. Point sources in the NEI include large industrial facilities and electric power plants, airports, and smaller industrial, non-industrial and commercial facilities. A small number of portable sources such as some asphalt or rock crushing operations are also included. Some states voluntarily also provide facilities such as dry cleaners, gas stations, and livestock facilities, which are otherwise included in the NEI as nonpoint sources. The emissions potential of each facility determines whether that facility should be reported as a point source, according to emissions thresholds set in the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR).NEI nonpoint sources include emissions estimates for sources which individually are too small in magnitude to report as point sources. These emissions sources are included in the NEI as a county total or tribal total (for participating tribes).Examples include residential heating, commercial combustion, asphalt paving, and commercial and consumer solvent use.NEI onroad sources include emissions from onroad vehicles that use gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. These sources include light duty and heavy duty vehicle emissions from operation on roads, highway ramps, and during idling. The US EPA uses the MOVES model to compute onroad source emissions based on model inputs provided by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies. The MOVES model also computes refueling emissions, which are included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category.NEI nonroad sources include off-road mobile sources that use gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. Source types include construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft ground support equipment, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels. For many nonroad sources, the EPA uses the MOVES-NONROAD model and these sources are included in the EIS nonroad Data Category. Starting with the 2008 NEI, some nonpoint sources are included in other EIS Data Categories. Aircraft engine emissions (occurring during landing and takeoff operations) and the ground support and power unit equipment are included in the EIS Point Data Category at airport locations. Locomotive emissions at rail yards are also included in the EIS Point Data Category. Emissions of other locomotive emissions and of commercial marine vessel emissions (both underway and port emissions) are included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category.NEI ""event"" sources include fires that are reported in a day-specific format: wildfires and prescribed burns. Generally, the US EPA calculates these emissions using a satellite detection approach combined with fire models and activity data provide by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies or forestry agencies. Starting in the 2008 NEI, Wildfires and prescribed burning sources are included in the EIS Event Data Category. Agricultural fires are reported in the “Nonpoint” data category as an annual sum for a county. Taken as a sum, agricultural fires, prescribed fires, and wild fires make up the total emissions that comprise the “National Fire Emissions Inventory” (NFEI).",2022-03-29 16:08:49+00:00,

Data can also be exported for offline workflows. Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data. Data Note from the Census:Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see Accuracy of the Data).  The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables. Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in September. The layer always contains the latest available ACS 5-year estimates. It is updated annually within days of the Census Bureau's release schedule. Click here to learn more about ACS data releases.Boundaries come from the US Census TIGER geodatabases. Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintage as specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500k TIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles. The original AWATER and ALAND fields are still available as attributes within the data table (units are square meters). Field alias names were created based on the Table Shells file available from the American Community Survey Summary File Documentation page.Data processed using R statistical package and ArcGIS Desktop.Margin of Error was not included in this layer but is available from the Census Bureau.  Contact the Office of Planning for more information about obtaining Margin of Error values.",2022-06-26 20:34:29+00:00,

This law: Prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco—including flavored synthetic nicotine products.Prohibits the sale of all electronic smoking devices within a quarter mile of any middle or high school in the District.The prohibition on flavored tobacco includes any flavor other than tobacco, including “menthol.” The law presumes that a tobacco product is a flavored tobacco product if there are any texts, images, statements, or actions by the manufacturer that suggests the product has a flavor other than tobacco. Electronic smoking devices include any device that uses a heating element to deliver a vapor or aerosol with nicotine or any other substance in it for human consumption. It includes “vapes,” “vape pens,” “e-cigarettes,” “e-cigars,” “e-hookahs,” or any other product with that function, regardless of what it is called. The distance from a school is determined from the closest point between the school grounds and the property containing the retail space. Schools with combined campuses qualify if any students at that location are in grades 6 – 12. District of Columbia Public Schools, District of Columbia Charter Schools, and private schools all qualify. Penalties for violations begin at $25 for individuals and range up to $10,000 for businesses. In addition, violations may be prosecuted as unfair or deceptive trade practices and may result in the suspension or revocation of any applicable business license. Civil penalties increase with each violation of the law; further details concerning civil penalties are listed in the law. There is an exception for the on-site consumption of flavored tobacco products at hookah bars that were doing business in the District as of September 30, 2021 or previously. Hookah bars are defined within the Act to be a restaurant, tavern, brew pub, club or nightclub that does not admit patrons under the age of 21 and that generates revenue from the onsite consumption of tobacco products used by hookah. A hookah bar doing business in the District as of September 30, 2021, will not need to relocate to be in compliance with this section.Violations may be reported to the DLCP Consumer Protection Unit (CPU) form.In most cases, an investigator is assigned within 3 business days. Investigations are typically completed within 30 business days.Remove any potentially prohibited products immediately. Contact DLCP at dlcp@dc.gov or 202-671-4500 if you have questions or for more information.The sale of electronic smoking device within one quarter mile of any middle or high school is prohibited.  This DLCP E-Cigarette Enforcement Map shows the spatial relationship between school and licenses e-tobacco businesses in DC.  Please report any violations to dlcp@dc.gov or 202-671-4500.",2022-11-07 03:36:10+00:00,

It includes structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates based on 2010 and 2013 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures from them by relating the roof polygons to an underlying Digital Elevation Model (2005 DEM developed by Earthdata) This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to buildings identified in the course of the District of Columbia’s separate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not have been captured. It also uses an updated production process that addresses base elevation errors in the earlier product, where some buildings appeared to be taller than they were because the earlier production process had left them floating above the desired surface and this had been corrected by extending the walls of those structures down to the desired surface. This dataset contains full buildings (including facades and detailed rooftops. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke out those elements into separate facades, complete roofs, and roof elements (protruding gabled windows, chimneys, elevator utility rooms, etc.). In many instances, row-houses and other contiguous buildings could not be broken apart using the process methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire blocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they can be distinguished easily. Many data gaps in the earlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery) are corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC’s available planimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are omitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of 99% of the District’s buildings are reflected in this dataset.",2022-12-14 18:16:09+00:00,

Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data. Data Note from the Census: Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see Accuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables. Data Processing Notes: This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.
